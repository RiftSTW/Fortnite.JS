# Fortnite.JS
Fortnite Lobby Bot that uses FNBR.js as it's library.


# How to use:

Sign into your bot account through epic games if you don't have one sign up for a new epic account with a temp email or one you don't really use.

Download all packages by launching "INSTALL PACKAGES.bat" after that run the "run.bat" file.

It'll ask you for your auth code you can get that by clicking this link: https://www.epicgames.com/id/logout?redirectUrl=https%3A//www.epicgames.com/id/login%3FredirectUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.epicgames.com%252Fid%252Fapi%252Fredirect%253FclientId%253D3446cd72694c4a4485d81b77adbb2141%2526responseType%253Dcode

The program will generate a new json file with your bot account's device auth meaning you don't need to re-type your auth code again unless you change the account's credintals.

Once it says that it's logged in go on fortnite and add your bot account as a friend on your main account and join the bot's party then BAM you got the lobby bot working!

Go to the party chat and type "!help" (without quoations) for a full list of the commands.

Please note that more commands will be coming out soon if you want to know when or need help with the bot join my discord server: https://www.discord.gg/GvHfG33
